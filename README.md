# Diabetes Dataset Statistical Analysis - DSAI 307

A comprehensive statistical analysis project examining diabetes risk factors and patient characteristics using R programming. This project was completed as part of the DSAI 307 Statistical Inference course.

## 📊 Project Overview

This project performs in-depth statistical analysis on a diabetes dataset to identify patterns, relationships, and risk factors associated with diabetes. The analysis includes exploratory data analysis, hypothesis testing, and simulation studies.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Analyze glucose levels, BMI, age, and other health metrics between diabetic and non-diabetic patients
- Identify correlations and relationships between various health indicators
- Perform statistical hypothesis testing to validate claims about diabetes risk factors
- Conduct confidence interval simulations to understand sampling distributions

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **R Programming Language**
- **Libraries**: 
  - `readr` - Data reading and importing
  - `dplyr` - Data manipulation and transformation
  - `ggplot2` - Data visualization and plotting

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
```r
install.packages(c("readr", "dplyr", "ggplot2"))
```

### Running the Analysis
1. Clone this repository
2. Ensure the diabetes dataset is in the `data/` directory
